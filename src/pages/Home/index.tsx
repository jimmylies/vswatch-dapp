            ▼ Introduction
          </h2>
          <p>
            ValSan is a 3D collection of 2022 Watches. In this Watchpaper, you
            will discover how the VSWatch team wants to offer you a new NFT
            experience. The innovation of a title of ownership linked to an
            object, here a watch, orchestrated by the technology of the
            Blockchain. <br />
            <br />
            ValSan is the ambition to give birth to a new way of holding a
            material good from a dematerialized tool, an NFT.
            <br />
            Commonly used for its artistic side or for P2E game creation
            projects, VSWatch wants to highlight the clean use of an NFT in the
            current world in order to have traceability on the transactions
            performed, security and authenticity without flaw. Our long-term
            ambition is to become Elrond’s first boutique of reference.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thus, in order to become so, we will focus our development on
            several important pillars:
            <br />
            <br />
            1 • Having a committed and cohesive community that will be rewarded
            for its support.
            <br />
            2 • Respect the deadlines and the various stages announced on the
            Watchmap.
            <br />3 • Working with qualified people, delivering high quality
            products and services.
          </p>
          <h2
            onClick={(event) => {
              event.currentTarget?.parentElement
                ?.querySelectorAll('p')[1]
                .classList.toggle('display-pres');
              event.currentTarget?.parentElement
                ?.querySelector('.container-supply')
                ?.classList.toggle('display-pres');
            }}
          >
            ▼ Collection
          </h2>
          <p>
            Hosted on the Elrond Blockchain, each NFT will be categorized by
            different attributes (dial, bracelet, colors used), which will
            establish a level of rarity between each model.
            <br />
            <br />
            We chose to create a first collection of a 2022 supply to mark the
            first series of VSWatch. The Smart Contract based on the Elrond
            Blockchain technology will guarantee a random distribution of NFT
            during the launch of our mint.
            <br />
            <br />
            The first series will consist of 5 models:
            <br />
            <br />
            <span className='dw'>DW (Diawond Watch) : 42 NFTs</span>
            <br />
            <span className='gw'>GW (Gold Watch) : 180 NFT</span> <br />
            <span className='sw'>SW (Silver Watch) : 400 NFTs</span> <br />
            <span className='bw'>BW (Bronze Watch) : 600 NFTs</span> <br />
            <span className='cw'>CW (Common Watch) : 800 NFTs</span>

            </div>
          </div>
          <h2
            onClick={(event) => {
              event.currentTarget?.parentElement
                ?.querySelectorAll('p')[2]
                .classList.toggle('display-pres');
            }}
          >
            ▼ Watch Box
          </h2>
          <p>
            In order not to influence the dirty public on sales and to keep a
            little suspense on the different models of watches, we opted for a
            case sft when we proceed with mint.
            <br />
            <br />
            This case sft will burn on the VSWatch website and the smart
            contract will automatically send you a random watch model.
            <br />
            <br />
            1 SFT = 1 WATCH BOX
            <br />1 WATCH BOX = 1 WATCH NFT
            <br />
            <br />
            This strategy will allow us to delay but also to avoid a drop in the
            price for our holders.

                Currently in master of industrial design for 4 years, I
                specialized in automotive design. I started to take an interest
                in cryptocurrencies in 2016, but then in 2019 I started to
                invest. Loving beautiful objects, I have always been interested
                in watches and have the opportunity to work on an NFT related to
                this world is exciting. For my part, I am part of the design
                team, I imagine and I model the models of VSWatch watches.

                After I got my engineering degree, I became interested in design
                and design, I wanted to learn new skills, to see new horizons. I
                knew by name the world of cryptocurrencies and NFT, seeing
                passing from time to time people talking about this subject on
                networks. It was with the VSWatch team that I had the
                opportunity to get started. A set of elements, such as project
                values, content, and the desire to learn, pushed me to join the
                project.To date, I am part of the design team, where I imagine
                and model the first NFT of VSWatch.

              Yes, we have given the name of the “watchlist” role, which is
              commonly called the whitelist role. This role gives the advantage
              over the price of mint and participate in the presale. This role
              will be limited to 400 members.
              <br />
              <br />
              The “OG” role gives the right to many significant benefits,
              without penalizing newcomers. This role will be limited to 50
              members. THE BENEFITS of the OG role are:
